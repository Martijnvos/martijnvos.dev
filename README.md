## :rocket: Quick start

1.  **Clone this project.**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/martijnvos/martijnvos.dev.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd martijnvos.dev/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `martijnvos.dev` directory in your code editor of choice and enjoy the hot reloading!
